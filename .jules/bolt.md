**Learning:** `json.dumps(..., sort_keys=True)` is incredibly expensive when called inside a tight loop like Proof of Work mining.
**Action:** For partial updates where only one key changes (and it's the first key), pre-compute the static suffix of the JSON string and use simple string concatenation. This yielded a ~6x speedup. Always verify that the key order assumption holds true.
