RandCoin is a robust, Python-based blockchain implementation designed to demonstrate the power and potential of African digital currency innovation. Built by the founders of the **Apex of African Digital Excellence**, this project serves as a testament to engineering precision, financial security, and open-source collaboration.

Explicitly linked to the **South African Rand (ZAR)**, RandCoin prioritizes financial accuracy through strict `decimal.Decimal` usage and implements core blockchain features including Proof of Work mining, transaction validation, and replay protection.

## 🚀 Features

*   **ZAR Currency Integration**: All transactions and rewards are denominated in ZAR.
*   **Precision Engineering**: Utilizes Python's `decimal` module for zero-error financial calculations.
*   **Proof of Work**: Secure mining algorithm with adjustable difficulty.
*   **Replay Protection**: O(N) history scanning to prevent duplicate transactions.
*   **Zero External Dependencies**: Pure Python implementation using only standard libraries (`hashlib`, `json`, `time`, `typing`, `unittest`).
*   **Interactive CLI**: A user-friendly command-line interface for interacting with the blockchain.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage
