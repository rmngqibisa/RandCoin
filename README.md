# RandCoin
A simple outlined example to design a cryptocurrency based on the rand

This code creates a basic blockchain with a genesis block, a transaction class, a block class, and a blockchain class. The mine method in the block class simulates the mining process by incrementing the nonce until a hash with the desired number of leading zeros is found.

This example is only intended to give a basic understanding of how a blockchain works and is not meant to be used as the basis for a real cryptocurrency like RandCoin.
