# Contributing to RandCoin

Welcome to the **Apex of African Digital Excellence**! We are thrilled that you are interested in contributing to RandCoin, a project born from the vision of empowering the digital economy with the strength of the ZAR.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [RandCoin Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all forms, including code improvements, documentation updates, and bug reports.

### Branch Protection and Workflow

To ensure the integrity of our codebase, we enforce strict branch protection rules on the `master` branch:

1.  **Direct commits to `master` are prohibited.** All changes must come via Pull Requests (PRs).
2.  **Code Reviews:** All PRs require review and approval from a maintainer (specifically `@rmngqibisa`) before merging.
3.  **Status Checks:** All tests must pass before a merge can occur.

### Steps to Contribute

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  **Clone** your fork locally.
3.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`).
4.  **Make your changes**. Ensure you follow the coding style (Python type hints, docstrings).
5.  **Run Tests**: Run `python3 -m unittest discover tests` to ensure everything is working.
6.  **Commit** your changes with descriptive commit messages.
7.  **Push** to your fork.
8.  **Open a Pull Request** to the `master` branch of the original repository.

## Style Guide

*   Use Python 3.8+.
*   Follow PEP 8 guidelines.
*   Use `decimal.Decimal` for all financial calculations.
*   Write unit tests for new features.

Thank you for helping us build the future of African digital currency!
